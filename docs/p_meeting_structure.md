## Executive Summary
I propose a meeting structure for our small team to find the right balance between efficiency and bonding in a remote environment. It consists of a tactical meeting to move the work forward as a whole, issue meetings to discuss speficic topics, a retrospective and socialising events.

## Problem Description
Unfortunately I am not having as much time currently as I’d like to have to work on DevSociety and Coopreneurs. Therefore I am forced to spend my time efficiently. On the other hand, informal meetings and exchange is a way to build trust and community and are equally important. We need to find the right balance between structured and unstructured meetings.

## Solution Proposal
### Tactical Meeting (structured)
*Focused on operational work*

*Weekly 1h*

**Agenda:**
* How is everybody? (max. 10 min)
* Collection of open agenda points and new proposals
* New Proposals
* Review existing Work-Proposals (If discussion goes longer than 10 minutes → Issue Meeting)
* Open Agenda

### Issue Meeting (un-structured)
*Focused on issue specific work.*

*Everybody that needs to be involved.*

*Open Agenda*

### Retrospective (structured)
*Bi-weekly 1h*

**Agenda:**
* Describe the last two weeks in three words.
* What went well?
* What needs to be changed?

### Socialising (un-structured)
*To bond.*

*Monthly*

Could be remote:
* cooking
* pizza eating
* beer drinking
* online card game
* whatever

### Meetup Group
*To get in contact and meet new and interested people. It's a space for everybody to join and to learn more about the Coopreneurs*

*Monthly*
