## Problem Description
The last weeks enabled us to formulate a vision for what we want to create. To put more meat to the bone, how we’d like to archive this, we need to come up with a draft of key organisational practices. Existing preprints of new work organisations (e.g. holacracy) need to be analysed and adapted.

## Solution Proposal
I’d like to draft some key processes for the Coopreneurs with the help of publicly available resources and from first principles.

I think we should start from the needs of the organisation and of the individual. These needs will be complemented with assumptions about the individuals and with our coopreneurship principles. Taking then into account existing models, we should be able to draft a Coopreneurs operating system.
