## Problem Description
The creation and maintenance of a collection of written documents in a way, that is democratic, accessible, decentralised and feasible is necessary for the scaling of the coopreneurs. Miro is designed as a workspace and already getting confusing in some areas. I guess there is a simpler and free way to do it.

## Solution Proposal
The git workflow already enables the collaboration of thousands of contributors to distributed documents (code) in open source projects. It gives space for collaboration, discussion, proposals (sic!) and at the same time, provides a single source of truth. A docs builder on the other hand provides all this and at the same time a neat and searchable way to make the information easily accessible. I propose to use some docs builder for our agreements, guides and official documents.

## Example:

https://docsify.js.org/
